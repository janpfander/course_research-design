## Slides

The slides are available online as an HTML file. You can also download them in a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

## Data

-   [{{< fa file-csv >}} `ligue1.csv`](../data/ligue1.csv)

## Readings

-   Chapters 2, 6 and 7 in @wickhamDataScienceImport2023

## Assignment

### Task 1

Get familiar with the [syllabus](index.qmd) of this course.

### Task 2

Read the guide ["Welcome to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse"](../guides/install.qmd) on installation and install R, Rstudio, tidyverse (we'll talk more about that soon) and tinytex.

### Task 3

Read the [guide on `Rprojects`](../guides/r_projects.qmd), including the reference to [this short chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#projects).

### Task 4

1.  Create an RStudio Project.

2.  Create a folder named "data" in the project folder you just made.

3.  Download this CSV file and place it in that folder:

-   [{{< fa file-csv >}} `cars.csv`](../data/cars.csv)

4.  In RStudio, go to "File" \> "New File…" \> "Quarto Document…" and click "OK" in the dialog without changing anything.

5.  Delete all the placeholder text in that new file and replace it by copy-pasting this:

````

# Learning R

[Give me some Feedback on how the this first class went.]

[WRITE SOMETHING HERE LIKE "It was not so hard and I managed to get it all done" or whatever.]

# Read the data

> Read the `cars.csv` data into R. Make sure to use the correct path ("data/cars.csv"). Name the data frame "cars" when reading it in. You don't need to understand what all the variables mean. 

[PUT CHUNK HERE]

# What's the class of the `model` and the `year` variable?

[PUT CHUNK HERE]

> Subset the cars data by selecting only rows that correspond to the manufacturer "honda" and that shows only the columns for models and the year. Name that subset "honda_data" and print it. 

[PUT CHUNK HERE] 

# My first plots

> You haven't learned about plots yet. But to give you a taste for what's coming, execute the code chunk below and let the magic happen. Make sure your data frame is named "cars" for this to work

A plot on the distance that cars can travel per gallon. Note that we will hide the code when rendering by setting `echo: false`.

```{{r plot-data}}
#| echo: false
ggplot(cars, aes(x = hwy)) +
geom_histogram() +
labs(
title = "A Histogram",
x = "Higway MPG*", 
caption = "*miles per gallon, is the distance, measured in miles, that a car can travel per gallon of fuel."
)
```
````

6.  Save the Quarto file with some sort of name (**without any spaces!**)

7.  Your project folder should look something like this:

```{r project-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/project-structure.png", error = FALSE)
```

### Task 5

Work with R:

1.  Remove all the place holder text indicated by `[ ]`.

```{r insert-chunk-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="19%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images//insert-chunk-button.png", error = FALSE)
```

2.  Follow the instructions for the three chunks of code.

3.  Render your document, either as a `.pdf` or a `.html` file. Use the "Render" menu:

```{r render-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images//render-button.png", error = FALSE)
```

4.  Upload the rendered document in the Homework section on Moodle, under "Assignment 1".

5.  `r emoji::emoji("tada")` Party! `r emoji::emoji("tada")`

::: callout-tip
You'll be doing this same process for all your future problem sets. Each problem set will involve a Quarto file. You can either create a new RStudio Project directory for all your work:

```{r single-directory, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rproj-one-folder.png", error = FALSE)
```

Or you can create individual projects for each assignment and project:

```{r multiple-directories, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%",}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rproj-multiple-folders.png", error = FALSE)
```
