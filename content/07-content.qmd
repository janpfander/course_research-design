## Assignment

For this week's assignment you'll be working with penguin data.

![Cute penguins](images/penguins_cute.jpg)

Between 2007 and 2009, researchers collected data on penguins in three islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica: Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. The `penguins` dataset has data for 342 penguins from 3 different species: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie. It includes the following variables:

- `species`: The penguin's species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie)
- `island`: The island where the penguin lives (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen)
- `bill_length_mm`: The length of the penguin's bill, in millimeters (distance from the penguin's face to the tip of the bill)
- `bill_depth_mm`: The depth of the penguin's bill, in millimeters (height of the bill; distance from the bottom of the bill to the top of the bill)
- `flipper_length_mm`: The length of the penguin's flippers, in millimeters
- `body_mass_g`: The weight of the penguin, in grams
- `sex`: The sex of the penguin
- `year`: The year the observation was made

1. As always, make a new or use an existing R Studio project for your assignment. 

2. Download the penguin data set and load it into your quarto script.

### Graphs

```{r}
#|echo: false
library(tidyverse)
```

1. What is the relationship between penguin weight and bill depth? Plot bill depth (`bill_depth_mm`) on the x-axis and body mass (`body_mass_g`) on the y-axis. Use `geom_point()`

2. Make a new plot that colors these points by species. What can you tell about the relationship between bill depth and penguin weight?

3. Add a `geom_smooth()` layer to the plot and make sure it uses a straight line (hint: include `method="lm"` in the function). What does this tell you about the relationship between bill depth and body mass?

4. Change the plot so that there's a single line for all the points instead of one line per species. How does the slope of this single line differ from the slopes of the species specific lines? ***Why??***

5. What is the relationship between flipper length and body mass? Make another plot with `flipper_length_mm` on the x-axis, `body_mass_g` on the y-axis, and points colored by `species`. 

6. Facet (`facet_wrap`) the plot by island (`island`). What does this graph tell you ?

### Regression 

1. Does bill depth predict penguin weight? Run a linear regression (`lm()`) and interpret the estimate and the p.value. Interpret the result in light of previous plots that you have generated. 

2. Run different regression analyses for the different species (use `filter()`) to subset the data frame.
