As always, make a new or use an existing R Studio project for your assignment. \n\n2. You'll need to download these CSV files and put preferably put them in a folder named `data` in your project folder:\n\n- [{{< fa file-csv >}} `The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv`](../data/The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv)\n- [{{< fa file-csv >}} `The_Return_Of_The_King.csv`](../data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv)\n- [{{< fa file-csv >}} `The_Two_Towers.csv`](../data/The_Two_Towers.csv)\n\n3. Read in the separate data files. Make sure you have the `tidyverse` package loaded. \n\n4. Use the `bind_rows` function to merge the three data sets into a single data set. We haven't seen this function yet, look it up. Call the new merged data frame `lotr` (for \"lord of the rings\").\n\n5. We later want to plot gender differences. Have a look at the data. Why is it not yet in a tidy format? Explain. Then use `pivot_longer` to reshape the data frame by adding two new variables, `Gender` and `Words`, to the data frame. \n\n6. Does a certain gender dominate a movie? (Hint: Make a new summary data frame for which you group by `Gender` and then count sum the words.)\n\n7. Graph your summarized data. (Hint: use `geom_col` and the `Words` and `Gender` variables.)\n\n8. You've just plotted the averages across films. (Hint: Make a new summary data frame for which you group by both `Gender` and `Film` and then count sum the words.)\n\n9. Try to make a new plot in which you differentiate between the different films (Hint: use faceting by `Gender` or `Film`).\n\n10. How about species? Does the dominant species differ on average (don't differentiate between the three movies here)? (Hint: Proceed just as for `Gender` in the beginning: make a new summary data frame for which you group by `Species` and then count sum the words.)\n\n11. Create a plot that visualizes the number of words spoken by species, gender, and film simultaneously. Use the complete tidy `lotr` data frame. You don't need to create a new summarized dataset (with `group_by(Species, Gender, Film)`) because the original data already has a row for each of those (you could make a summarized dataset, but it would be identical to the full version). You need to show `Species`, `Gender`, and `Film` at the same time, but you only have two possible aesthetics (`x` and `fill`), so you'll also need to facet by the third. Play around with different combinations (e.g. try `x = Species`, then `x = Film`) until you find one that tells the clearest story. For fun, add a `labs()` layer to add a title and subtitle and caption.\n\n\n### Solution\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n[Here is a solution for the assignment](../problem_sets/03-solution.qmd){target=_blank}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
