You can also download them in a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"buttons\"><a class=\"btn btn-danger\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/01-slides.html\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square\"></i> View all slides in new window</a> <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/01-slides.pdf\" role=\"button\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download PDF of all slides</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Data\n\n-   [{{< fa file-csv >}} `ligue1.csv`](../data/ligue1.csv)\n\n## Readings\n\n-   Chapters 2, 6 and 7 in @wickhamDataScienceImport2023\n\n## Assignment\n\n### Task 1\n\nGet familiar with the [syllabus](index.qmd) of this course.\n\n### Task 2\n\nRead the guide [\"Welcome to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse\"](../guides/install.qmd) on installation and install R, Rstudio, tidyverse (we'll talk more about that soon) and tinytex.\n\n### Task 3\n\nRead the [guide on `Rprojects`](../guides/r_projects.qmd), including the reference to [this short chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts#projects).\n\n### Task 4\n\n1.  Create an RStudio Project.\n\n2.  Create a folder named \"data\" in the project folder you just made.\n\n3.  Download this CSV file and place it in that folder:\n\n-   [{{< fa file-csv >}} `cars.csv`](../data/cars.csv)\n\n4.  In RStudio, go to \"File\" \\> \"New Fileâ€¦\" \\> \"Quarto Documentâ€¦\" and click \"OK\" in the dialog without changing anything.\n\n5.  Delete all the placeholder text in that new file and replace it by copy-pasting this:\n\n````         \n---\ntitle: \"Problem set 1\"\nauthor: \"Put your name here\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n  pdf:\n    toc: true\n  docx:\n    toc: true\n---\n\n```{{r packages}}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n# Learning R\n\n[Give me some Feedback on how the this first class went.]\n\n[WRITE SOMETHING HERE LIKE \"It was not so hard and I managed to get it all done\" or whatever.]\n\n# Read the data\n\n> Read the `cars.csv` data into R. Make sure to use the correct path (\"data/cars.csv\"). Name the data frame \"cars\" when reading it in. You don't need to understand what all the variables mean. \n\n[PUT CHUNK HERE]\n\n# What's the class of the `model` and the `year` variable?\n\n[PUT CHUNK HERE]\n\n> Subset the cars data by selecting only rows that correspond to the manufacturer \"honda\" and that shows only the columns for models and the year. Name that subset \"honda_data\" and print it. \n\n[PUT CHUNK HERE] \n\n# My first plots\n\n> You haven't learned about plots yet. But to give you a taste for what's coming, execute the code chunk below and let the magic happen. Make sure your data frame is named \"cars\" for this to work\n\nA plot on the distance that cars can travel per gallon. Note that we will hide the code when rendering by setting `echo: false`.\n\n```{{r plot-data}}\n#| echo: false\nggplot(cars, aes(x = hwy)) +\ngeom_histogram() +\nlabs(\ntitle = \"A Histogram\",\nx = \"Higway MPG*\", \ncaption = \"*miles per gallon, is the distance, measured in miles, that a car can travel per gallon of fuel.\"\n)\n```\n````\n\n6.  Save the Quarto file with some sort of name (**without any spaces!**)\n\n7.  Your project folder should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/project-structure.png){width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Task 5\n\nWork with R:\n\n1.  Remove all the place holder text indicated by `[ ]`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images//insert-chunk-button.png){width=19%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Follow the instructions for the three chunks of code.\n\n3.  Render your document, either as a `.pdf` or a `.html` file. Use the \"Render\" menu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images//render-button.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Upload the rendered document in the Homework section on Moodle, under \"Assignment 1\".\n\n5.  ðŸŽ‰ Party! ðŸŽ‰\n\n::: callout-tip\nYou'll be doing this same process for all your future problem sets. Each problem set will involve a Quarto file. You can either create a new RStudio Project directory for all your work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/rproj-one-folder.png){width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr you can create individual projects for each assignment and project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/rproj-multiple-folders.png){width=30%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### Solution\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n[Here is a solution for the assignment](../problem_sets/01-solution.qmd){target=_blank}\n:::\n\n## References\n",
