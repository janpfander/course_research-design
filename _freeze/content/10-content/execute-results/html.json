You can also download them in a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"buttons\"><a class=\"btn btn-danger\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/10-slides.html\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square\"></i> View all slides in new window</a> <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/10-slides.pdf\" role=\"button\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download PDF of all slides</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n## Readings\n\nI don't expect you to read all these, but in case you're curious, here are some papers mentioned in class:\n\n-   @opensciencecollaborationEstimatingReproducibilityPsychological2015\n\n-   @simmonsFalsePositivePsychologyUndisclosed2011\n\n-   @gouldSameDataDifferent2025\n\n-   @turnerSelectivePublicationAntidepressant2008\n\nFor a refresher on hypothesis testing and statistical power, you could can have a look at the begging of [chapter 2](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/02-errorcontrol.html) in @lakensImprovingYourStatistical2022d\n\nSince the lecture did not really cover this, if you want to know what's wrong with scientific publishing, [this old (but gold!) article of the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science) is a good read. It's also available as a podcast.\n\n## Data\n\n-   [{{< fa table >}} `imaginary_beatle_experiment.csv`](../data/imaginary_beatle_experiment.csv)\n\n## Assignment\n\nNo assignment for this session ðŸŽ‰\n",
