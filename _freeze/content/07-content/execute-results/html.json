The `penguins` dataset has data for 342 penguins from 3 different species: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie. It includes the following variables:\n\n- `species`: The penguin's species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie)\n- `island`: The island where the penguin lives (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen)\n- `bill_length_mm`: The length of the penguin's bill, in millimeters (distance from the penguin's face to the tip of the bill)\n- `bill_depth_mm`: The depth of the penguin's bill, in millimeters (height of the bill; distance from the bottom of the bill to the top of the bill)\n- `flipper_length_mm`: The length of the penguin's flippers, in millimeters\n- `body_mass_g`: The weight of the penguin, in grams\n- `sex`: The sex of the penguin\n- `year`: The year the observation was made\n\n1. As always, make a new or use an existing R Studio project for your assignment. \n\n2. Download the penguin data set and load it into your quarto script.\n\n- [{{< fa file-csv >}} `penguins.csv`](../data/penguins.csv)\n\n\n### Graphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|echo: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. What is the relationship between penguin weight and bill depth? Plot bill depth (`bill_depth_mm`) on the x-axis and body mass (`body_mass_g`) on the y-axis. Use `geom_point()`\n\n2. Make a new plot that colors these points by species. What can you tell about the relationship between bill depth and penguin weight?\n\n3. Add a `geom_smooth()` layer to the plot and make sure it uses a straight line (hint: include `method=\"lm\"` in the function). What does this tell you about the relationship between bill depth and body mass?\n\n4. Change the plot so that there's a single line for all the points instead of one line per species. How does the slope of this single line differ from the slopes of the species specific lines? ***Why??***\n\n5. What is the relationship between flipper length and body mass? Make another plot with `flipper_length_mm` on the x-axis, `body_mass_g` on the y-axis, and points colored by `species`. \n\n6. Facet (`facet_wrap`) the plot by island (`island`). What does this graph tell you ?\n\n### Regression \n\n1. Does bill depth predict penguin weight? Run a linear regression (`lm()`) and interpret the estimate and the p.value. Interpret the result in light of previous plots that you have generated. \n\n2. Run different regression analyses for the different species (use `filter()`) to subset the data frame. \n\n\n### Solution\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n[Here is a solution for the assignment](../problem_sets/05-solution.qmd){target=_blank}\n:::\n\n\n",
