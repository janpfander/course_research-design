You can also download them in a static PDF (for printing or storing for later).

[Fill out this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DtSUFU5JT9IUnzGxG2nNjlzkcI_Tslzo4N8NUMnSGo/edit?usp=sharing) with your name, distance to school, and whether you prefer cats or dogs \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nBe very careful in how you fill out the sheet as in the first example row (otherwise it will be a point to analyze later for everyone).\n\n- distance to school: use the exact value in kilometers, with decimals indicated by `.`\n- preference for cats/dogs: write either \"cats\" or \"dogs\", nothing else (got to make a choice, sorry)\n:::\n\n\n**Are people who prefer cats living further away from University?** This will be your research question for the assignment. \n\n2. Once everyone has filled out the spreadsheet, download the data and read it into R. As always, make a new or use an existing R Studio project for your assignment. \n\n3. Complete the following steps\n\n- **Step 1: Calculate an estimate based on your sample**\n\n- **Step 2: Use simulation to invent a world where the true effect is null.**\n  - Simulate 1000 samples with the same sample size that your estimate is based on. Store the estimates of this simulation in a vector called `sampling_distribution`.\n\n- **Step 3: Plot how well this estimate fits into your null world.**  \n\n- **Step 4: Calculate the probability that your estimate could exist in the null world.**  \n  Use the standard deviation of your `sampling_distribution` to transform your initial estimate in a z-value. Based on this, calculate the p-value. \n  \n- **Step 5: Decide if your estimate is statistically significant.**  \n  Use a significance threshold (the value at which you consider your estimate sufficiently unlikely to have occurred in the Null World) of 0.05\n\n\n4. Is this result surprising to you or not? Explain.\n\n\n### Solution\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n[Here is a solution for the assignment](../problem_sets/04-solution.qmd){target=_blank}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
